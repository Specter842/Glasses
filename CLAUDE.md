Single-user, local-first **Android app** (`com.glasses.app`): schedule/timetable,
attendance tracker and learning tracker. No accounts, no cloud sync, dark mode
only. **Fully offline: no AI, no network, and no Android permissions at all.**

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v3, built as a **static
  export** (`output: "export"` → `out/`) and wrapped with **Capacitor** into a
  native Android project (`android/`). There is **no server** — everything runs
  client-side inside the WebView.
- **On-device data**: the whole dataset is one JSON document held in memory and
  persisted with **Capacitor Preferences** (localStorage in the browser,
  native storage on Android). No SQLite.
  - `lib/store.ts` — DB shape, first-run seed, selectors, and all mutation
    functions (pure `(draft, args) => void`). `normalizeDB` migrates old shapes.
  - `lib/persist.ts` — load/save via Preferences.
  - `components/DataProvider.tsx` — React context; `useData()` returns
    `{ db, ready, mutate, reset }`.
- **No AI, no network.** The AI layer (Gemini timetable import, NL schedule
  commands, attendance explainer, weekly summary) was removed deliberately. Do
  not reintroduce a model, an API key, an SDK, or the `INTERNET` permission
  without asking. Everything the app does is deterministic local computation.

## Layout
- `lib/types.ts` — domain types. `CourseType` is `LECTURE | TUTORIAL | PRACTICAL`
  (the old `LAB` migrates to `PRACTICAL`). `lib/time.ts` — local date/time
  helpers (dates `YYYY-MM-DD`, times `HH:MM`, day_of_week 0=Sun..6=Sat).
- `lib/schedule.ts` — `renderDays(db, dates)`: TimetableSlot + DateOverride +
  ClassInstance → the concrete classes per date. Single source of truth.
- `lib/attendance.ts` — `computeCourseAttendance`: per-course held/attended/%,
  `maxMoreSkippable`, `recoverCount`. Formulas are fixed (see Permanent rules).
- Routes → screens (pages are thin; screens are client components reading
  `useData()`): `/` → `CalendarScreen`, `/attendance` → `AttendanceScreen`,
  `/tracker` → `TrackerScreen`, `/money` → `MoneyScreen`,
  `/learning` → `LearningScreen`, `/setup` → `SetupScreen`.
- `components/BottomNav.tsx` — fixed bottom tab bar, reserved for daily-use
  screens: Calendar · Attendance · Tracker · Money · Learning. **Setup is a gear
  in the header**, not a tab (six tabs don't fit at 375px).
- `lib/money.ts` — pure finance helpers. **Amounts are integer minor units
  (paise) everywhere**; they only become a decimal string at the edge, via
  `formatMoney`. Never store or add floats. `suggestItems` powers the item
  autocomplete: it is scoped to the chosen category and ranks by how *often*
  you've bought a thing, with recency only as a tie-breaker
  (`score = count + 1/(1 + ageDays/14)`), prefix matches first. Deterministic —
  no model, no network.
- Accounts and categories cannot be deleted while a transaction references them
  (`accountInUse` / `categoryInUse`); the UI disables the control rather than
  orphaning rows. Currency is a display-only symbol in `db.settings`.
- Budgets are one monthly limit per expense category (`setBudget` upserts;
  amount ≤ 0 removes). `budgetStatuses` flags near (≥80%) / over; the Money
  screen warns for the current month only.
- **Wishlist** (`/money/wishlist`, an internal page reached via the Spending /
  Wishlist toggle) is a plain to-buy list — name, Need/Want, optional estimate,
  bought flag. It never touches balances; buying stays a manual transaction.
- **Done tasks are purged daily.** `purgeOldDoneTasks` (run once by
  `DataProvider` after load, next to `runRecurring`) drops tasks whose
  `completed_at` date is before today, so a task ticked off today stays visible
  until the next new day. Idempotent.
- **Recurring rules materialise into real transactions** via `runRecurring`,
  called once by `DataProvider` after load. It is deterministic and idempotent:
  `occurrencesBetween` only generates dates in `(last_run, today]`, monthly days
  clamp to the month length (31 → Feb 28), and `last_run` advances every run —
  so opening the app repeatedly never double-charges. The recurrence math is
  unit-tested; keep it that way if you touch it.
- **Tracker** (`/tracker`, `TrackerScreen`) is a single screen with a segmented
  switch over three panels in `components/tracker/`: **Habits** (`HabitsPanel`),
  **To-do** (the shared `TaskPanel`, moved here off the Calendar) and **Notes**
  (`NotesPanel`). Each panel reads `useData()` directly; the screen owns the
  `ready` gate and the toggle.
- Habits: a `HabitLog` row existing for (habit, date) means "done that day" —
  toggling adds/removes the row, so there is no third state. The month grid is
  the input surface (future days locked) and `components/habits/TallyMarks.tsx`
  renders the monthly count as real tally marks: groups of five drawn as four
  uprights struck through by a diagonal.
- Notes are plain free-text jottings (`Note` = id + text + created_at) with no
  dates or status. `addNote` / `updateNote` / `deleteNote` / `getNotes` in
  `lib/store.ts`; newest first. They never touch any other collection.

## Build / run
- `npm run dev` — browser preview (data in localStorage).
- `npm run cap:sync` — `next build` then `cap sync android`.
- `npm run cap:open` — open in Android Studio (Run ▶ builds/installs).
- CLI APK: JDK 17+ and Gradle 8.7 (wrapper pinned); Android Studio's bundled JBR
  works. Debug APK → `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
- Icons: edit `scripts/make-assets.mjs`, then
  `node scripts/make-assets.mjs && npx capacitor-assets generate --android`.

## Permanent rules
- Stack is Next.js (static export) + Capacitor + Tailwind, data via the on-device
  store. Don't add a server, a second framework, or a second datastore without
  asking.
- **Git: every commit is pushed to `origin` (github.com/Specter842/Glasses).
  Never add Claude as a co-author or `Co-Authored-By` trailer.**
- **Every action is deterministic.** Clear/duplicate schedule, task CRUD, course
  and resource status, attendance marking, delete timetable — all call store
  functions directly. There is no model, no chat box, and no network call
  anywhere in the app.
- **Attendance is per course, not a weighted overall.** A course is one timetable
  course code (so `UES101L` and `UES101P` are two courses). Each is judged against
  its own `attendance_threshold_pct` (default 75). `held` = instances with status
  ATTENDED or ABSENT; `attended` = ATTENDED; percentage = `attended / held`.
  CANCELLED instances are excluded (a cleared day and a "class cancelled" mark
  both set CANCELLED). Per-course safety-margin formulas are fixed once written.
- **Custom calendar events never touch attendance.** `CalendarEvent` rows render
  alongside classes (dashed border, EVENT tag, no Attended/Absent controls), and
  clearing a day cancels its classes while leaving its events intact. Only the
  timetable feeds the attendance denominator.
- **Each timetable grid cell is one class period.** Two consecutive cells of the
  same course are two slots, never merged — a day's attendance denominator is
  simply the number of periods on that day.
- When marking attendance, the options are **Attended / Absent / Class
  cancelled** — cancelled removes the class from the denominator.

## Design tokens
- Strict base: background `#000000`, text `#FFFFFF`. Neutrals are white-over-
  black tones only (surface `#0C0C0C`, border `#242424`, secondary `#9A9A9A`).
- Only three hues + neon shades: royal blue `#2E5BFF`/`#5B8CFF`, light royal
  green `#17C964`/`#37FF8B`, royal red `#E11030`/`#FF2D55`. Semantics:
  **blue = primary/interactive, green = safe (≥ threshold), red = danger
  (< threshold)**.
- Instrument Sans for UI, JetBrains Mono for every number. Bottom tab bar
  navigation. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
